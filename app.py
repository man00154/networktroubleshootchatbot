    ### Troubleshooting 'No Internet Connection'

    1.  **Check Physical Connections:** Ensure all cables (Ethernet, power) are securely plugged into the modem, router, and your computer. Look for any damaged or loose cables.
    2.  **Restart Devices:**
        * Unplug the power from your modem and router.
        * Wait for 30 seconds.
        * Plug the modem back in and wait for all lights to stabilize.
        * Plug the router back in and wait for it to boot up.
        * Restart your computer or device.
    3.  **Check Indicator Lights:** On your modem and router, a solid green or blue light usually indicates a healthy connection. A red or blinking light often signals a problem. Check the manual for specific meanings.
    4.  **Test with Another Device:** Try connecting to the internet with a different device (e.g., phone or tablet) to see if the issue is with your computer or the network itself.
    5.  **Run Network Troubleshooter:** On Windows, use the built-in troubleshooter. On macOS, use Wireless Diagnostics. These can often identify common issues.
    6.  **Contact Your ISP:** If all else fails, the problem may be on your Internet Service Provider's end. Contact their support for assistance.

    ### Troubleshooting 'Slow Network Speed'

    1.  **Run a Speed Test:** Use a reliable service like speedtest.net to measure your current download and upload speeds. This confirms if the issue is with your overall connection speed.
    2.  **Reduce Connected Devices:** A large number of devices using the network simultaneously can slow it down. Disconnect unused devices.
    3.  **Check for Background Downloads:** Ensure no large files are downloading or updating in the background on any device.
    4.  **Restart Your Router:** Rebooting the router can clear its cache and improve performance.
    5.  **Check Wi-Fi Signal Strength:** Move closer to your router or use a Wi-Fi analyzer app to check for signal interference.
    6.  **Update Router Firmware:** Check your router's manufacturer website for any available firmware updates, which can improve performance and security.

    "wi-fi not working": """
    ### Troubleshooting 'Wi-Fi Connection Issues'

    1.  **Check Wi-Fi Switch:** Many laptops and some desktops have a physical switch or key combination to turn Wi-Fi on or off.
    2.  **Forget and Reconnect:** On your device, "forget" the Wi-Fi network and then try to connect to it again, entering the password as if it were a new connection.
    3.  **Verify Password:** Double-check that you are entering the correct Wi-Fi password.
    4.  **Move Closer to the Router:** Physical distance and obstacles can degrade Wi-Fi signal quality.
    5.  **Check for Interference:** Other electronic devices, like microwaves and cordless phones, can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal.

    ### Finding and Renewing Your IP Address

    **To find your IP address:**
    * **Windows:** Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`.
    * **macOS:** Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or check System Settings > Network.
    * **Linux:** Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip addr show`.

    **To renew your IP address:**
    * **Windows:** Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig /renew`.
    * **macOS / Linux:** Open Terminal and type `sudo dhclient -r` followed by `sudo dhclient`.

        **Simple "Vector DB":** In a real-world application, the `NETWORK_TROUBLESHOOTING_KB` would be a
        large, external database. When you ask a question, your query would be converted into a
        vector (a list of numbers) and used to search the database for the most semantically
        similar documents. This process is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
        
        **Fine-Tuning:** The model used here (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`) is a base model. "Fine-tuning"
        involves training a model on a very specific dataset (e.g., thousands of network logs and solutions)
        to make its responses even more specialized and accurate for a particular task. This is an
        offline process that would occur before deployment.
        
        **Multi-Modal AI:** The Gemini family of models is multi-modal, meaning they can process
        and understand more than just text. They can also work with images, audio, and video.
        For network troubleshooting, you could extend this app to allow a user to upload a screenshot
        of an error message or a picture of their router's lights. The model could then analyze
        the image to provide a more targeted solution. This is a potential future improvement.
